I would like to thank soniCron for all his hard work for finding the mathematical formulation to get the values for the scripts, as well as his ideology for the scripts functions. 

Secondly I would like to thank Alcolawl for the inspiration to make these scripts for the 6P as well as some original script base that has now been greatly modified.

Third I would like to thank flar2 for all of his hard work on the elementalx kernel keeping devices running buttery smooth, as well as his great work on the EXKM app, and agreeing to add the profile to the app in future editions. 

Last but not least I would like to thank DespairFactor for his great work on his kernels, and Kylo Kernel for the nexus 6P.He has also provided me with some support when necessary which is always much appreciated.
